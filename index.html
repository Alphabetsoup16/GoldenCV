        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="indent">
          I currently live outside the metro Detroit area. 
          In my spare time between working, online school to finish my CS degree, rock climbing, and planning for a wedding, I am programming. 
          I really enjoy the problem solving process of designing programs and microservices.
          I mostly program in C#/.Net and Python but love to experiment with Java, Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and associated frameworks.
          I do my best to stay up to date on all the newest features in programming languages as well as new frameworks and tools.

        <h2>Machine Learning & AI</h2>
        <p class="indent">
          Understanding the basic concepts of machine learning and AI modeling is an essential tool for data scientists and software engineers alike. 
          The philosophical and technical issues around building, weighting, and classifying models is paramount to achieve accurate, fair, and fit outcomes. 
          The majority of my studying into this subject has revolved around Scikit in Python, PyTorch, and and ML.Net in C#. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Visualizing and cleaning data for use in machine learning has been a challenging task that has taught me many lessons. 
          Utilizing regression, classification, clustering, reinforcement learning, time series, and NLP(natural language processing) modeling is key to becoming a well rounded user of machine learning and AI tools and libraries. 
          I will continue to work diligently to learn all facets of this incredibly interesting topic of computer science.

        <h2>Data Visualization & Management</h2>
        <p class="indent">
          Data has become the most valuable resource in the modern digital age. 
          Many large tech companies rely heavily on the intrinsic value of the data they possess and continuously look for new ways of analyzing and visualizing that data as well. 
          Understanding how truthful that data is, as well as how much reliance a company can place on it, is an incredibly important undertaking. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Purely quantitative analysis is only part of the picture; companies must engage business and executive level personnel to recognize the patterns in this data to make accurate assumptions and predictions. 
          Presenting this information or data to non-technical people or employees is extremely relevant to maximizing the positive impacts of aggregating and analyzing ever greater volumes of data. 
          This process is exemplified during product development, maintenance, customer experiences, fraud detection and compliance, new innovations, machine learning/AI, and many more areas of business. 
          I personally spend a considerable amount of time learning to understand these principals and work on applying them to make me a better developer and innovator.
