        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I currently live outside the metro Detroit area. 
          In my spare time between working, online school to finish my CS degree, rock climbing, and planning for a wedding, I am programming. 
          I really enjoy the problem solving process of designing programs and microservices.
          I mostly program in C#/.Net and Python but love to experiment with Java, Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and associated frameworks.
          I do my best to stay up to date on all the newest features in programming languages as well as new frameworks and tools.
